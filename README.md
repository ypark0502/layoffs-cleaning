# Data Cleaning Project on Layoffs

## Process
* Importing raw CSV as flat-file in SQL Server
* False duplicates (had to manually check and make sure that I was properly deleting based on correct parameters)
* Trimming company names by removing whitespace
* Standardizing industry names for similar industries (i.e. "Crypto" vs "Crypto Currency" Industry Names)
* Standardizing string values to be NULL
* Fixing missing data by joining and comparing to complete data
